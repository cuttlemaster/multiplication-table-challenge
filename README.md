# multiplication-table-challenge

This project originated as a fun technical challenge for the development team at Clearlink in order to test their use of table markup, vanilla CSS, and ES6. The team had been leveraging frameworks and other pre-built tools heavily for a long time and I wanted to break them out of that habit and give them something a bit "old school" to test their knowledge instead of relying on pre-built solutions. As such, I wanted to complete the challenge along with them.

### Challenge Instructions

Create a page that contains a single button. When that button is clicked it should prompt the user first for a number of rows and then prompt them again for a number of columns. These prompts should only accept positive numbers and not allow a number higher than 12 to be input. If no number is given, default the value to 12.

After accepting the user input, use those numbers to generate a multiplication table using HTML Table markup.

The table cells should show the mathmatical problem (i.e. 3 x 2) and the answer.

**Example: 3 x 2 = 5**

No styles are required, but if you choose to use styles they must utilize vanilla CSS. No pre-processors allowed!
