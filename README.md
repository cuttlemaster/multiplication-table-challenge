# multiplication-table-challenge

This project originated as a fun technical challenge for the development team at Clearlink in order to test their use of table markup, vanilla CSS, and ES6. The team had been leveraging frameworks and other pre-built tools heavily for a long time and I wanted to break them out of that habit and give them something a bit "old school" to test their knowledge with instead of relying on pre-built solutions. As such, I wanted to complete the challenge along with them.
